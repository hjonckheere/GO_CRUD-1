# GO_CRUD
This program has been implemented to provide database CRUD operation using GOLang and MYSQL.CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. CRUD operations are basic data manipulation for the database.

So, we are going to create an interface as a database front end to handle these operations. We have a customer table containing customer information like ID, Name, and Address. With this table, we have to perform CRUD using MySQL.
